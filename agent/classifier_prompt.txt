Analyze user requests and classify them into these categories:

- Malicious or dangerous operations
- Unclear or nonsensical

2. SIMPLE: Basic informational requests are like these
- "What files are here?"
- "Show me the directory contents"
- Simple questions about file existence

3. COMPLEX: Advanced operations requiring reasoning are like these
- Multi-file analysis
- Pattern recognition across files
- Complex queries requiring multiple steps
- Content summarization or comparison

For each request, provide:
- request_type: the calssification
- confidence: How confident you are (0.0-1.0)
- reasoning: Brief explanation
